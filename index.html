        <p class="text">I am a Software Engineering Consultant working for a Retailer. I love to travel &#x1F6E9; &#x1F681; &#x1F6F3; &#x1F682; . I have been to 23 states here in the US so far and I hope to reach 50 soon.&#x1F601</p>

        <p class="text">I am married to a beautiful wife &#x1f64e;. Her name is Anuja. She happens to be really good with Computer Programming and Math.</p>

        <p class="text">I am counting on the bootcamp program to learn the MERN stack &#x1F4DA;. Over the years, I have learnt that being a Full Stack Engineer and being able to productize a vision or idea is a powerful combination. I am hoping to acquire that skill by the end of the year.</p>
